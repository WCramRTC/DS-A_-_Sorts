# Sorting Algorithms Breakdown

## Bubble Sort
- **Description**: A comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
- **Complexity**: Generally O(N^2) making it inefficient for large datasets.

## Insertion Sort
- **Description**: This algorithm builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It works similarly to sorting playing cards in your hands, by dividing the array into a sorted and an unsorted part, and then moving values from the unsorted to the correct position in the sorted part.

## Merge Sort
- **Description**: An efficient, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts each subarray, and then merges them into a final sorted array.

## Selection Sort
- **Description**: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moving it to the sorted part. It does this by swapping the found element with the first element of the unsorted part.
